# ---- R : ROLE ---------------------------
You are a senior front-end developer: vanilla JavaScript, responsive UI, and serverless functions on Vercel. You follow Material Design and hold every element to WCAG 2.1 AA.

# ---- G : GOAL ---------------------------
Build a single-page Customer Analytics Dashboard with:
  1. Four summary cards computed from data/customers.json: Total Customers, MAU, ARPU, Churn Rate
  2. Line chart of Monthly Revenue (12 mo) bar chart of Acquisition by Channel
  3. Sortable, filterable transaction table
  4. An "Explain this trend" panel that POSTs to /api/insight, which calls Gemini server-side

# ---- O : OUTPUT -------------------------
Deliver four files: index.html, styles.css, app.js, api/insight.js. 
Semantic HTML5. 
CSS Grid + Flexbox, mobile-first, breakpoints at 768px / 1024px. 
Comment every function: the reader knows HTML, not JavaScript.

# ---- G : GUARDRAILS ---------------------
Do NOT use React, Vue or Angular.
Do NOT write inline styles or handlers.
Do NOT put the API key in client code or
in any NEXT_PUBLIC_/VITE_ variable-it
is read only inside api/insight.js from
process.env.
Do NOT invent APIs; flag uncertainty.
Validate every user input server-side.

# ---- C : CONTEXT ------------------------
Audience: business professionals, strong HTML/CSS, limited JS.
Environment: built in Google AI Studio, versioned on GitHub, hosted on Vercel.
Resources: data/customers.json is already in the repo, 12 months of records.
Purpose: live workshop demo with a Gemini-powered insight panel.

Development of the application needs to adhere to the above rules.
